    <h4>Conway's Game of Life</h4>
    <p>
      Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automation zero-player game invented by mathematician
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway" target="_blank">John Conway</a> in 1970.
    </p>
    <p>
      The universe of this game is an infinite 2D grid of cells that can be either alive or dead. On each turn, the
      neighbours of a given cell determine if the cell is alive or dead based on a series of rules. For a more
      in-depth explanation, check out

      Conway's Game of Life is the most known rule set, there are a number of variations such as
      <a href="http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Highlife" target="_blank">highlife</a> which is
      known for it's frequently occurring replicators. If you want to read more about the Game of Life, you can
      check out <a href="http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">LifeWiki</a> which has a huge
      database of information. This page will go over the rules that exist in the game, and some interesting patterns.

    <h5>Rule String</h5>
    <p>
      The rule string describes when a cell survives or is born into the next generation. In the rule string <b>S</b>
      stands for <b>survival</b> and <b>B</b> stands for <b>birth</b>. The digits that follow S/B indicate the
      neighbor count required for a cell to either survive or birth. For instance in Conway's Game of Life, the rule
      string is B3/S23 which means for a cell to become alive (or birth), it will need three neighbor cells to be alive,
      and for a cell to continue to stay alive (or survive) it will need two or three neighbor cells to be alive. If
      none of these conditions are met, the cell will die/remain dead.

          oscillators, some of infinitely extensible size and period.

        <td>B3/S012345678</td>

        <td>B36/S125</td>
        <td>2x2</td>
        <td>A chaotic rule with many simple still lifes, oscillators and spaceships. Its name comes from the fact that
          it sends patterns made up of 2x2 blocks to patterns made up of 2x2 blocks.

        <td>Move</td>
        <td>A rule in which random patterns tend to stabilize extremely quickly. Has a very common slow-moving spaceship
          and slow-moving puffer.
