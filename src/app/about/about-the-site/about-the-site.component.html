    <h4>Purpose</h4>
    <p>
      The purpose of this site is to allow users to explore the phenomenon of cellular automaton within the bounds of
      the Game of Life. The user can experiment with their own creations, view over 1500 previously created patterns,
      and apply different themes to create beautiful life forms.

    <h4>Site Map</h4>
    <p>Here are some details about each of the tabs on the site.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Editor</b> The Game of Life editor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Patterns</b> A massive list of Game of Life patterns. Over 1500! Don't forget to mouse over
        (or press for mobile) to preview the pattern.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Themes</b> Themes gives you the ability to change how the Game of Life board looks. Be sure to turn on
        generations
        for some neat effects, but for larger patterns, it is best to turn this feature off.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>About</b> General details about the site, the Game of Life, and some interesting links.

    <h4>Patterns</h4>
    <p>
      All patterns in the patterns section come from
      <a href="http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Life Wiki</a>. The users of this site have
      spent a huge amount of effort creating and collecting these patterns. Without those patterns, this site would not
      exist. The list of patterns on this site was last updated from Life Wiki around June, 2017.

    <h4>Development</h4>
    <p>
      I originally started on this site because I wanted to learn how to use the javascript framework
      <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular</a>. It was never meant to be a fully operational
      website. Unfortunately, I broke my ankle playing soccer which gave me a lot more free time. Lacking inspiration
      I kept pushing this site further and further until it looks like the site you see today.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Game of Life algorithm I used is called
      <a href="http://dotat.at/prog/life/life.html" target="_blank">Tony Finch's List Life algorithm</a>. I also used
      <a href="http://pmav.eu/stuff/javascript-game-of-life-v3.1.1/" target="_blank">this site</a> as inspiration for
      my choice of algorithm and used the site to help me through learning the best way to utilize the html canvas
      element.
    </p>
    <p>
      For future development I would like the site to use the Hashlife algorithm since the list life algorithm doesn't
      handle large cellular automaton. I would also like to fix some of the loading times on the template page. I don't
      plan on adding a backend to this project. If you are interested in contributing to the site, check it out on
