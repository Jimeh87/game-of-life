# GameOfLife

The purpose of this project is to allow users to explore the phenomenon of cellular automaton within the bounds of the game of life. The user can experiment with their own creations, view over 1000 previously created templates, and apply different themes to create beautiful life forms.

## Demo

[Heroku App](http://gameoflife87.herokuapp.com/)

## Development
I originally started on this site because I wanted to learn how to use the javascript framework Angular. It was never meant to be a fully operational website. Unfortunately, I broke my ankle playing soccer which gave me a lot more free time. Lacking inspiration I kept pushing this site further and further until it looks like the site you see today.

## Latest updates
* Upgraded from Angular 4 to Angular 6.
* Upgraded from the alpha build of bootstrap 4 to bootstrap 4.1.
* Upgraded some random other packages.
* Switched to Yarn from npm.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
